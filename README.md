This is a video, music and media streaming service for exclusive and controversial content. 
With Now, artists and content creators can express their work in a free manner without being judged and victims of shadow ghosting and demonetisation. 
As part of the charather of this app, it is legislated as a plataform that sells ficticious content. 
We dont take any responsability in the veracity or consequence that media being exposed can carry to the general public.
Its still an adult plataform with age restriction.
Super explicit pornograhic or gore content is not allowed and will be subject to trial before exposure.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
