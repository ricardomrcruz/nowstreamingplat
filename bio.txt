NOW is a streaming platform that showcases controversial, censored, and demonetized content from various major platforms in today's world. With NOW, artists, entrepreneurs, and content creators have the freedom to express themselves without constraints related to their political agenda. While we provide a space for unrestricted creativity, we do enforce certain guidelines. Content that falls under categories such as pornography, excessively graphic gore, or the promotion of criminal activities is strictly prohibited. However, artistic nudity is permitted within our guidelines. We strive to maintain a platform with minimal verbal censorship, but hate speech that incites acts of murder, genocide, or suicide will be prohibited. While there is currently no public free speech platform available, we offer a more relaxed approach compared to other platforms.
